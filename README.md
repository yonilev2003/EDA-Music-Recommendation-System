## About The Project

In my project, I analyzed a 170,000 songs dataset from Spotify and built my own item-based music recommender system.

### Key Features

- **In-depth Analysis:** Dive deep into the dataset with comprehensive exploratory data analysis, featuring data visualization and statistical testing to uncover hidden patterns and relationships.
- **Statistical Significance:** Using statistical tests to challenge and validate hypotheses, providing a robust foundation for model predictions.
- **Recommendation System:** Crafting a content-based recommendation system - advising your next song based on choosing only one favorite song.
- **Practical Insights:** Beyond the numbers, gain actionable insights on the factors influencing the music industry.

### Built With

This project is brought to life using Python and a host of libraries designed for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning, including:

- Pandas & NumPy for data wrangling
- Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
- Scikit-learn for building the recommendation system

## Getting Started

To explore this project and run the models yourself, you'll need to set up your environment and install the necessary dependencies.

### Prerequisites

- A Python environment (recommendation: use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) for easy management)
- Installation of the required libraries:
  
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone [https://github.com/yonilev2003/Predicting-loan-approval-rates.git](https://github.com/yonilev2003/EDA-Music-Recommendation-System)
   ```
2. Install Python packages
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

For those looking to apply the model to recommend music, the project provides a detailed notebook that guides you through the data analysis and model building. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, a musician, or simply someone curious about data science and machine learning's potential in musical decision-making, this project has something for you.
